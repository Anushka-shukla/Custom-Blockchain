# Custom-Blockchain in JAVA
## Blockchain 
#### Blockchain is a specific type of database. It differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together. As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block.
Each block contains its own digital fingerprint called Hash, the hash of the previous block, a timestamp and the data of the transaction made, making it more secure towards any kind of data breach.

## Implementation of the Blockchain
<ol>
<li> Creating new Transactions</li>
<li> Creating Blocks</li>
<li> Generating Hashes</li>
</ol>

## Advantages of the Blockchain

- Blokchain is a distributed network of systems. Therefore, data breaches are very difficult to be carried out.
- Since, Blockchain generated hashes of each block, therefore, it is very difficult to carry out malicious attacks.
- Data Tampering will change the hash of each block which will make the blockchain invalid

To read more on Blockchain I have made some [notes](https://github.com/Anushka-shukla/Custom-Blockchain/blob/master/notes.md).

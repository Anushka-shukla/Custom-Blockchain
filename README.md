# Custom-Blockchain in JAVA
## Blockchain 
#### A Blockchain is a list of records called blocks that are linked together using linked lists and use the cryptographic technique.
Each block contains its own digital fingerprint called Hash, the hash of the previous block, a timestamp and the data of the transaction made, making it more secure towards any kind of data breach.

## Implementation of the Blockchain: 
<ol>
<li> Creating new Transactions</li>
<li> Creating Blocks</li>
<li> Generating Hashes</li>
</ol>

## Advantages of the Blockchain:

- Blokchain is a distributed network of systems. Therefore, data breaches are very difficult to be carried out.
- Since, Blockchain generated hashes of each block, therefore, it is very difficult to carry out malicious attacks.
- Data Tampering will change the hash of each block which will make the blockchain invalid

- Every blockchain consists of a cluster of nodes functioning on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network system. Every node in a network has a copy of the shared ledger which gets updated timely. Each node can verify transactions, initiate or receive transactions and create blocks.
- There are primarily two types of blockchains; Private and Public blockchain. However, there are several variations too, like Consortium and Hybrid blockchains.
#### Public Blockchain
- A public blockchain is a non-restrictive, permission-less distributed ledger system. Anyone who has <i>access to the internet can sign in on a blockchain platform to become an authorized node and be a part of the blockchain network. A node or user which is a part of the public blockchain is authorized to access current and past records, verify transactions or do proof-of-work for an incoming block, and do mining. The most basic use of public blockchains is for mining and exchanging cryptocurrencies.</i> Thus, the most common public blockchains are Bitcoin and Litecoin blockchains.
